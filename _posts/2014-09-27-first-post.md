I want to write blog for quite a long time, but didn't do anything untill now.

I just setup this blog on github with the help of jekyll, a static bloging engine written on ruby.

From now on, I plan to write one post each week, hoping that I can keep doing this and make a good habit.

It's late now, so just write this for now.
